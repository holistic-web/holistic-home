## Known Issues

- linting doesn't seem consistent across projects, and still need the .vue extension?

- occasionally nanoleaf brightness doesn't fire when changing colour, seems to be a race condition worth looking into

- themes contain more information about lights than they need to, they only need light ID and state

- scene loads as unselected for a light when entering scene mode. Should have a default value

- creating a new theme takes you to the themes list page rather than the new theme's detail page
