## Known Issues

- linting doesn't seem consistent across projects, and still need the .vue extension?

- themes contain more information about lights than they need to, they only need light ID and state

- nanoleaf scene loads as unselected for a light when entering scene mode. Should have a default value

- legacy lights, themes, and users collections need to be cleanedup. Remember to backup what we need to!
