# Roadmap

## General

- terminology for 'Themes' (being the state of things) and 'Scenes' (a mode for an individual light) should be swapped

## Multiple Users

- the sign up screen should allow a user to view 'networks' (homes) they are a member of

- the sign up screen should allow a user to create a personal network if they haven't already.

- inviting a user to a 'network' (home) should send them an email


## Orchestration UI

- design and UX tender love and care would be very welcome, including a favicon

- could use some form of navigation aid or breadcrumb to show a user where they are in the site, maybe a right drawer menu?

- scenes should have something to indicate what they look like in the UI

- lights should be displayed using a palette rather than as hex code and brightness

- light control user experience should be improved, collapse colourpicker when not in use and don't show controls if light is off

- Loading... and Submitting... messages should be replaced with icons


## Light Control

- relevant IFTTT triggers be created as part of a 'create light process' allowing users to set up their own lights

- lights should be able to be grouped to be treated as one device


### Button Control

- buttons should be able to set a new state for the network

- user should be able to add a button and have it set up relevant IFTTT triggers, similar to what's planned above for lights
