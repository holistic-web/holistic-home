# Roadmap

## General

- terminology for 'Themes' (being the state of things) and 'Scenes' (a mode for an individual nanoleaf light) should be swapped

## Multiple Users

- the sign up screen should allow a user to create a personal network if they haven't already.

- inviting a user to a 'network' (home) should send them an email

- owner's of a network should be able to designate a new owner

- only admin's and owners should be able to edit a network's settings

## Orchestration UI

- favicon

- Loading... and Submitting... messages should be replaced with icons


## Light Control

- relevant IFTTT triggers be created as part of a 'create light process' allowing users to set up their own lights

- lights should be able to be grouped to be treated as one device
