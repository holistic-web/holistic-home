## Roadmap

##Â General

- the concepts of `Themes` storing a state and `Scenes` setting a light should be swapped

- the site could use some design tender love and care, including a favicon


## Sharing

- other users should be able to sign up and have their own lights

- they should be able to set their own authenticated users


### Orchestration UI

- could use some form of navigation aid or breadcrumb

- scenes should have something to indicate what they look like in the UI

- should be able to update lights one by one

- user experience should be smoother: if off don't show inputs for lights

- Could use some form of default layout component

- Loading... and Submitting... messages should be replaced with icons


### Light Control

- these should use native apis rather than IFTTT if possibel to reduce response times

- relevant IFTTT triggers should be managed through the IFTTT API

- lights should be able to be grouped to be treated as one
